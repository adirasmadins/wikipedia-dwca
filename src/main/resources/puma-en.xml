The '''cougar''' (''Puma concolor''), also known as '''puma''', '''mountain lion''', '''mountain cat''',  '''catamount''' or '''panther''', depending on the region, is a [[mammal]] of the family [[Felidae]], native to the Ameri
cas. This large, solitary cat has the greatest [[range (biology)|range]] of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the [[Western Hemisphere]],&lt;ref name=&quot;diet&quot;/&gt; extending from [[Yukon]] in Canada to the southern [
[Andes]] of South America. An adaptable, [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] species, the cougar is found in every major [[Americas|American]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] type. It is the second heaviest cat in th
e [[Eastern and Western Hemispheres|Western Hemisphere]], after the [[jaguar]]. Although large, the cougar is most closely related to smaller felines and is closer genetically to the [[Domestic cat]] than to true lions.A capable stalk-and-ambush [[predator]], the cougar pursues a wide variety of [[prey]]. Primary food sources include [[ungulate]]s such as [[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], and [[bighorn sheep]], as well as domestic cattle, horses and [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], particularly in the northern part of its range. It will also hunt species as small as insects and [[rodents]]. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but it can also live in open areas. The cougar is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and persists at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While it is a large predato
r, it is not always the [[Apex predator|dominant species]] in its range, as when it competes for prey with other predators such as the [[jaguar]], [[grey wolf]], [[American Black Bear]], and the [[grizzly bear]]. It is a reclusive cat and usually avoids people. [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade|Attacks on humans]] remain fairly rare, despite a recent increase in frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Med&quot;/&gt;Due to excessive hunting following the [[European colonization of the Americas]] and the continuing human development of cougar [[habitat]], populations have dropped in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for an isolated [[Florida panther|sub-population in Florida]]. However, in recent decades, breeding populations have moved east into the far western parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Also, transient males have been verified as far east as the [[Upper Peninsula]] of Michigan and Illinois, where a cougar was shot in the city limits
of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cougarnet.org/centralmidwest.html |title=The Cougar Network – Using Science to Understand Cougar Ecology |publisher=Cougarnet.org |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&l

==Naming and etymology==
With its vast range, the cougar has dozens of names and various references in the [[mythology]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] and in contemporary culture. The cougar has numerous names in En
glish, of which ''puma'' and ''mountain lion'' are popular. Other names include ''catamount'', ''panther'', ''mountain screamer'' and ''painter''. Lexicographers regard ''painter'' as a primarily upper-Southern U.S. regional va
riant on &quot;panther&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/61/P0016100.html|title=transcription of '&amp;#39;American Heritage Dictionary'&amp;#39;|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[folk etymology]], fancying a resemblance between the typically dark tip of its tail and a paintbrush dipped in dark paint, has some currency.
The cougar holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] record for the animal with the highest number of names, presumably due to its wide distribution across [[North America|North]] and South America. It has over 40 names in
English alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Guinness Book of World Records| year = 2004| page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Cougar&quot; may be borrowed from the archaic [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''çuçuarana'', via French; the term was originally derived from the [[Tupi language]]. A current form in [[Brazil]] is ''suçuarana''. It may also be borrowed from the [[Guaraní language]] term ''guaçu&amp;nbsp;ara'' or ''guazu&amp;nbsp;ara''. &quot;Puma&quot; comes, via Spanish, from the [[Quechua language]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=co

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Image:Puma face.jpg|thumb|Although large, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines.]]
[[File:Cougar closeup.jpg|thumb|Close-up front face.]]
The cougar is the largest of the small cats. It is placed in the subfamily [[Felinae]], although its bulk characteristics are similar to those of the [[big cat]]s in the subfamily [[Pantherinae]].&lt;ref name=MSW3/&gt; The [[family (biology)|family]] [[Felidae]] is believed to have originated in Asia approximately 11 million years ago. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=DNA Offers New Insight Concerning Cat Evolution |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/science/06cats.html?ex=1294203600&amp;en=4b75c4da1cdc2167&amp;ei=5090 |work=New York Times |date= January 6, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as cats are poorly represented in the [[fossil record]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt; and there are significant [[confidence intervals]] with suggested dates.
In the latest [[genomic]] study of Felidae, the common ancestor of today's ''[[Leopardus]]'', ''[[Lynx]]'', ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'', ''[[Prionailurus]]'', and ''[[Felis]]'' lineages migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into the Americas approximately 8 to 8.5&amp;nbsp;million years ([[annum|Mya]]) ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson, W.E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. &amp; O'Brien, S.J. |date=January 6, 2006 |number=5757 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 |title=The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73–77 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |pmid=16400146}}&lt;/ref&gt; North American felids then invaded South America 3 Ma ago as part of the [[Great American Interchange]], following formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The cougar was originally thought to belong in ''Felis'' (''Felis concolor''), the genus which includes the [[domestic cat]]. As of 1993, it is now placed in ''Puma'' along with the [[jaguarundi]], a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight.

Studies have indicated that the cougar and jaguarundi are most closely related to the modern [[cheetah]] of Africa and western Asia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Culver&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Culver, M. |coauthors=Johnson, W.E., Pecon-Slattery, J., O'Brein, S.J. |year=2000 |title=Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=186–97 |url=http://www.coryi.org/Florida_panther/Miscellaneous_Panther_Material/Genomic%20ancestry%20of%20the%20American%20puma.pdf |format = PDF | doi = 10.1093/jhered/91.3.186 |pmid=10833043}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship is unresolved. It has been suggested that the cheetah lineage diverged from the ''Puma'' lineage in the Americas (see [[American cheetah]]) and migrated back to Asia and Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Culver&quot;/&gt; while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the [[Old World]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Barnett |coauthors=Ian Barnes, Matthew J. Phillips, Larry D. Martin, C. Richard Harington, Jennifer A. Leonard, and Alan Cooper |date=August 9, 2005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205008365 |title=Evolution of the extinct Sabretooths and the American cheetah-like cat |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=15 |pages=R589–R590 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.052 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |pmid=16085477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of [[Felinae|small feline]] migration to the Americas is thus unclear.

Recent studies have demonstrated a high level of genetic similarity among the North American cougar populations, suggesting that they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver ''et al.'' suggest that the original North American population of ''Puma concolor'' was [[local extinction|extirpated]] during the [[Pleistocene extinctions]] some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals such as ''[[Smilodon]]'' also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by a group of South American cougars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culver&quot;/&gt;

===Subspecies===
Until the late 1980s, as many as 32 [[subspecies]] were recorded; however, a recent [[Genetics|genetic]] study of [[mitochondrial DNA]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Culver&quot;/&gt; found that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level. Following the research, the canonical ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (3rd edition) recognizes six subspecies, five of which are solely found in Latin America:&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id = 14000204|pages=544–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the [[Florida panther]], here collapsed into the North American Cougar, remains uncertain. It is still regularly listed as subspecies ''Puma concolor coryi'' in research works, including those directly concerned with its conservation.&lt;ref name=improving&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael J. |last=Conroy |coauthors=Paul Beier; Howard Quigley; Michael R.

[[Image:Cougar Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Although cougars resemble the [[domestic cat]], they are about the same size as an adult human.]]
The head of the cat is round and the ears erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a [[dewclaw]]) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhosWho&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?pid=1&amp;id=87&amp;cid=8 |title=Cougar |work=Hinterland Who's Who |accessdate=May 22, 2007 |publisher=[[Canadian Wildlife Service]] and [[Canadian Wildlife Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cougars can be almost as large as jaguars, but are less muscular and not as powerful; where their ranges overlap, the cougar tends to be smaller than average. The cougar is on average larger and heavier than the leopard. Despite its size, it is not typically classified among the &quot;[[big cats]]&quot;, as it cannot roar, lacking the specialized [[larynx]] and [[hyoid]] apparatus of ''Panthera''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weissengruber |first=GE |coauthors=G Forstenpointner, G Peters, A Kübber-Heiss, and WT Fitch |title=Hyoid apparatus and pharynx in the lion (Panthera leo), jaguar (Panthera onca), tiger (Panthera tigris), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus) |work=Journal of Anatomy |publisher=Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland |pages=195–209 |volume=201 |issue=201 |year=2002 |month=September |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1570911 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x |accessdate=May 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like domestic cats, cougars vocalize low-pitched hisses, growls, and purrs, as well as chirps and whistles. They are well known for their screams, as referenced in some of their common names, although these screams are often misinterpreted to be the calls of other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easterncougar.org/pages/abouteasterncougars.htm |title=About Eastern Cougars |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |publisher=Eastern Cougar Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Puma concolor paw.jpg|thumb|Rear paw of a cougar]]
Cougar coloring is plain (hence the [[Latin]] ''concolor'') but can vary greatly between individuals and even between siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but ranges to silvery-grey or reddish, with lighter patches on the under body including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt; juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY&quot;/&gt; Despite anecdotes to the contrary, all-black coloring ([[melanism]]) has never been documented in cougars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-tribune.net/features/cnhinsoutdoors_story_032111454.html |title=Black cougar more talk than fact |date=February 1, 2006|accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Tahlequah Daily Press|quote=[[Game Warden]]: Never in the history of the United States has there ever been, in captivity or in the wild, a documented black mountain lion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[black panther]]&quot; is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species, particularly jaguars and leopards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/mutant-pumas.html |title=Mutant Pumas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cougars have large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the cat family.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt; This physique allows it great leaping and short-sprint ability. An exceptional vertical leap of 5.4&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;ft) is reported for the cougar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-puma.html |title=Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar) |accessdate=April 2, 2007 |work=San Diego Zoo.org |publisher=[[San Diego Zoo|Zoological Society of San Diego]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal jumping capability from standing position is suggested anywhere from 6 to 12&amp;nbsp;m (20 to 40&amp;nbsp;ft). The cougar can run as fast as 55 to 72&amp;nbsp;km/h (35 to 45&amp;nbsp;mi/h),&lt;ref name=&quot;CanGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/mj04/indepth/justthefacts.asp |title=Cougars in Canada (Just the Facts) |accessdate=April 2, 2007 |publisher=[[Canadian Geographic Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is best adapted for short, powerful sprints rather than long chases. It is adept at climbing, which allows it to evade [[Canidae|canine]] competitors. Although it is not strongly associated with water, it can swim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sierra&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arizona.sierraclub.org/conservation/mt-lion/index.asp |title= Mountain Lion, Felis concolor |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=[[Sierra Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting and diet===
A successful [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] [[predator]], the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large [[ungulate]]s (over 500&amp;nbsp;kg). Like all cats, it is an [[obligate carnivore]], feeding only on meat. The mean weight of vertebrate prey (MWVP) was positively correlated (r=0.875) with puma body weight and inversely correlated (r=-0.836) with food niche breadth in all [[Americas|America]]. In general, MWVP was lower in areas closer to the Equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;diet&quot;/&gt; Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[elk]], and even large [[moose]] are taken by the cat. Other species such as Bighorn Sheep, [[Mustang (horse)|wild horses of Arizona]], domestic horses, and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3672527 |url=http://wf2dnvr2.webfeat.org/|title=Influence of Predation by Mountain Lions on Numbers and Survivorship of a Feral Horse Population |first=John W. |last=Turner |first2=Michael L. |last2=Morrison |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |year=2008 |journal=[[The Southwestern Naturalist]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=183–190 |jstor=3672527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer.

Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed [[bighorn sheep]], while others relied heavily on the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=R. |coauthors=Jalkotzy, MG., Festa-Bianchet, M. |month=May | year=1993 |title=Cougar predation on bighorn sheep in southwestern Alberta during winter |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=771–75 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=4321651 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |doi=10.1139/z97-098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-size mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the [[capybara]]. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, approximately half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items.&lt;ref name=&quot;diet&quot;/&gt; Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, [[porcupine]], and [[hare]]s. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;diet&quot;/&gt; Not all of their prey is listed here due to their large range.

Though capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an [[ambush predator]]. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhosWho&quot;/&gt;

Kills are generally estimated at around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature at around 15 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt; The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. It is generally reported that the cougar is a non-[[scavenger]] and will rarely consume prey it has not killed; but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bauer |first=Jim W. |coauthors=Kenneth A.

[[Image:Mountain lion kittens.jpg|thumb|left|Cougar cubs]]
Only females are involved in parenting. Female cougars are fiercely protective of their cubs, and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as grizzly bears in their defense. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two or three. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they begin to go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites, and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Utah&quot;/&gt; Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt;

Young adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier; males tend to leave sooner. One study has shown high [[mortality rate|mortality]] amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars ([[intraspecific competition]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Utah&quot;/&gt; Research in [[New Mexico]] has shown that &quot;males dispersed significantly farther than females, were more likely to traverse large expanses of non-cougar habitat, and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dispersal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sweanor |first=Linda |coauthors=Kenneth A.

Life expectancy in the wild is reported at between 8 to 13 years, and probably averages 8 to 10; a female of at least 18 years was reported killed by hunters on [[Vancouver Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt; Cougars may live as long as 20 years in captivity. One male North American cougar, named Scratch, was two months short of his '''30th''' birthday when he died in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scratch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigcatrescue.org/forever/scratchcougar.htm |title=Scratch |accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease, competition with other cougars, starvation, accidents, and, where allowed, human hunting.

===Social structure and home range===
Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and [[crepuscular]], being most active around dawn and dusk.

Estimates of territory sizes vary greatly.
''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' reports large male territories of 150 to 1000 square kilometers (58 to 386&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) with female ranges half the size.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanGeo&quot;/&gt; Other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of 25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) but an even greater upper limit of 1300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (500&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) for males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Utah&quot;/&gt; In the United States, very large ranges have been reported in Texas and the [[Black Hills]] of the northern [[Great Plains]], in excess of 775&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (300&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dordt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.dordt.edu/~mahaffy/mtlion/mtlionshort_behaviour.html |title=Behavior of cougar in Iowa and the Midwest |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |last=Mahaffy |first=James |year=2004 |month=December |publisher=[[Dordt College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male ranges may include or overlap with those of females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males, which serves to reduce conflict between cougars. Ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other. Scrape marks, [[urine]], and [[feces]] are used to mark territory and attract mates. Males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sierra&quot;/&gt;

Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Utah&quot;/&gt; One female adjacent to the [[San Andres Mountains]], for instance, was found with a large range of 215&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (83&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dispersal&quot;/&gt; Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as much as 7 (in one study in South America) per 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt;

Because males disperse farther than females and compete more directly for mates and territory, they are most likely to be involved in conflict. Where a sub-adult fails to leave his maternal range, for example, he may be killed by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dordt&quot;/&gt; When males encounter each other, they hiss, spit, and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.&lt;ref name=&quot;UWSP&quot;/&gt; Hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young, transient animals into conflict with established individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mountain Lion (Felis concolor) study on Boulder Open Space |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |date=March 22, 2007 |work=Letter to the Parks and Open Space Advisory Committee, Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Sinapu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
===Distribution and habitat===
[[Image:06g.jpg|thumb|right|Cougar on Animal Reserve Guaycolec, [[Formosa, Argentina]].]]
The cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas. Its range spans 110 degrees of [[latitude]], from northern [[Yukon]] in Canada to the southern [[Andes]]. It is one of only three cat species, along with the [[bobcat]] and [[Canadian lynx]], native to Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhosWho&quot;/&gt; Its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type: it is found in all forest types as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts. Studies show that the Cougar prefers regions with dense underbrush, but can live with little vegetation in open areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; Its preferred habitats include precipitous canyons, escarpments, rim rocks, and dense brush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sierra&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:MountainLion.jpg|thumb|left|Cougar, photographed in the [[Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum]], Tucson, Arizona]]
The cougar was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] across much of its eastern North American range (with the exception of Florida) in the two centuries after [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], and faced grave threats in the remainder of its territory. Currently, it ranges across most western American states, the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], and the Canadian [[Yukon Territory]]. There have been widely debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0305/0305_selections.html |title=Bookshelf |last=Marschall |first=Laurence A. |year=2005 |month=March |work=Natural Selections |publisher=[[Natural History Magazine]] |accessdate=May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA]] evidence has suggested its presence in eastern North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/Local/2007/05/24/4205568.html |first=Joe |last=Belanger |title=DNA evidence of cougars found in southern Ontario |date=May 24, 2007 |publisher=[[London Free Press]] |accessdate=June 5, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports, from the mid-western [[Great Plains]] through to Eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cougarnet.org/bigpicture.html |title=The &quot;Big&quot; Picture |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |author=[http://www.cougarnet.org/network.html Board of Directors] | year=2004| publisher=The Cougar Network}} ''The Cougar Network methodology is recognized by the [http://www.fws.gov/northeast/ECougar/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service].''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quebec]] wildlife services (known locally as MRNF) also considers Cougar to be present in the province as a threatened species after multiple DNA tests confirmed cougar hair in Lynx mating sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/faune/especes/menacees/faire.jsp |title=Your part in helping endangered species |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |author=[MRNF] | year=2010| publisher=Quebec MRNF}} ''Ministry of Wildlife and natural resources [http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca Wildlife Service].''&lt;/ref&gt; The only unequivocally known eastern population is the [[Florida panther]], which is critically endangered.

South of the [[Rio Grande]], the [[World Conservation Union|International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) lists the cat in every [[Central America|Central]] and [[South American]] country except [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; While specific state and provincial statistics are often available in North America, much less is known about the cat in its southern range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nwf.org/cats/pdfs/cougarfacts.pdf | format = PDF | title = Cougar facts | accessdate =May 20, 2007 | publisher=[[National Wildlife Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cougar's total breeding population is estimated at less than 50,000 by the IUCN, with a declining trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; U.S. state-level statistics are often more optimistic, suggesting cougar populations have rebounded.

===Ecological role===
Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild. The cat is not, however, the [[apex predator]] throughout much of its range. In its northern range, the cougar interacts with other powerful predators such as the [[brown bear]] and [[gray wolf]]. In the south, the cougar must compete with the larger [[jaguar]]. In Florida it encounters the [[American alligator]].[[Image:Puma Pfote.png|thumb]] [[Image:Cougar track.jpg|thumb|Front paw print of a cougar. An adult paw print is approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;inches) long.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovBC&quot;/&gt;]]
The [[Yellowstone National Park]] ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter-predator interaction in North America. Of the three large predators, the massive brown bear appears dominant, often although not always ab
le to drive both the gray wolf pack and the cougar off their kills. One study found that brown or [[American black bear]]s visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Parks]], usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113%, and cougars lost up to 26%, of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=COSEWIC. Canadian Wildlife Service |title=Assessment and Update Status Report on the Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos) |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |year=2002 |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-166-2002E.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, especially in winter. While individually more powerful than the gray wolf, a solitary cougar may be dominated by the pack structure of the canines. Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat. One report describes a large pack of fourteen wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens. Conversely, lone wolves are at a disadvantage, and have been reported killed by cougars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A2158-2003May17&amp;notFound=true |title=In Yellowstone, it's Carnivore Competition |last=Gugliotta |first=Guy |date=May 19, 2003 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline's behavior.

In the southern part of South America the puma is a top level predator that has controlled the population of [[Guanaco]] and other species since prehistoric times.==Hybrids==
[[Image:Pumapard-1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Pumapard, photographed in 1904]]
{{Main|Pumapard}}A pumapard is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal resulting from a union between a cougar and a [[leopard]]. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] at his animal park in [[Hamburg]], Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by [[Berlin Zoological Garden|Berlin Zoo]]. A similar hybrid in Berlin Zoo purchased from Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma. Hamburg Zoo's specimen was the reverse pairing, the one in the black-and-white photo, fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess.

Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard, or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body
 (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or &quot;faded&quot; rosettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|title=Geocites – Liger &amp; Tigon Info|accessdate=June 9, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015110856/http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) currently lists the cougar as a &quot;[[least concern]]&quot; species. The cougar is regulated under [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |title=Appendices I, II and III |accessdate=May 24, 2007 |publisher=[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.[[Image:Cougar snow.jpg|thumb|left|Cougar conservation depends on preservation of their habitat.]]In the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]], the only unequivocally known cougar population is the [[Florida panther]]. Until 2011, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) recognized both an [[Eastern Cougar]] (claimed to be a subspecies by some, denied by others)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bolgiano |first1=Chris |title=Mountain Lion:An Unnatural History of Pumas and People |place=[[Mechanicsburg, PA]] |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=August 1995 |edition=Hardcover |isbn=978-0-8117-1044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eberhart |first1=George M. |title=Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology |url=http://www.ebook3000.com/animals/Mysterious-Creatures--A-Guide-to-Cryptozoology_64383.html |volume=Volume 2 |location=[[Santa Barbara, CA]] |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2002 |pages= 153–161 |isbn=1-57607-283-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Florida panther, affording protection under the [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa48.html |title=Eastern Cougar |accessdate=May 20, 2007 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1991 |publisher=[[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403000340/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa48.html| archivedate = April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa05.html |title=Florida Panther |accessdate=June 7, 2007 | work=Endangered and Threatened Species of the Southeastern United States (The Red Book)| year=1993 |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604163840/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/a/saa05.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the [[North American Cougar]], with Eastern or Florida subspecies not recognized,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSW3&quot;/&gt; while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists.&lt;ref name=improving/&gt; The most recent documented count for the Florida sub-population is 87 individuals, reported by recovery agencies in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myfwc.com/panther/news/pdf/FWC2002-2003PantherGeneticRestorationAnnualReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 2002–2003 Panther Genetfic Restoration Annual Report |accessdate=June 5, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070616200443/http://myfwc.com/panther/news/pdf/FWC2002-2003PantherGeneticRestorationAnnualReport.pdf| archivedate = June 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2011, the USFWS declared the Eastern Cougar extinct. However, with the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies as well as the possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range, the subject remains open.&lt;ref name=&quot;barringer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barringer |first1=Felicity |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/us/03cougar.html?hpw |title=U.S. Declares Eastern Cougar Extinct, With an Asterisk |work=The New York Times |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This uncertainty has been recognized by Canadian authorities. The Canadian federal agency called [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] rates its current data as &quot;insufficient&quot; to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar's survival, and says on its Web site &quot;Despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern Canada, there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar.&quot; Notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in [[Ontario]], Quebec, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive: &quot;. . . there may not be a distinct 'eastern' subspecies, and some sightings may be of escaped pets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=132 Committee on Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturecanada.ca/endangered_know_our_species_ecougar.asp Eastern Cougar, Nature Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cougar is also protected across much of the rest of their range. As of 1996, cougar hunting was prohibited in [[Argentina]], Brazil, [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], Costa Rica, [[French Guiana]], Guatemala, [[Honduras]], Nicaragua, [[Panama]], Paraguay, [[Suriname]], Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]. (Costa Rica and Panama are not listed as current range countries by the IUCN.) The cat had no reported legal protection in [[Ecuador]], El Salvador, and [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;/&gt; Regulated cougar hunting is still common in the United States and Canada, although they are protected from all hunting in the [[Yukon]]; it is permitted in every U.S. state from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the Pacific Ocean, with the exception of California. Texas is the only state in the United States with a viable population of cougars that does not protect, in some way, its cougar population. In Texas, cougars are listed as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season, number killed, sex or age of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/mountain_lion/&lt;/ref&gt;  Killed animals are not required to be reported to [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]]. Conservation work in Texas is the effort of a non profit organization, [[Balanced Ecology Inc (BEI)]], as part of their [http://balancedecology.org/MountainLionWebSite/Mountain_Lion_Conservation_Project.html Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project]. Cougars are generally hunted with packs of [[Hunting dog|dogs]], until the animal is 'treed'. When the hunter arrives on the scene, he shoots the cat from the tree at close range. The cougar cannot be legally killed in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when an individual is declared a public safety threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;California&quot;/&gt; However statistics from the [[California Department of Fish and Game|Department of Fish and Game]] indicate that cougar killings in California have been on the rise since 1970s with an average of over 112 cats killed per year from 2000 to 2006 compared to six per year in the 1970s. The [[Bay Area Puma Project]] aims to obtain information on cougar populations in the San Francisco Bay area and the animals' interactions with habitat, prey, humans, and residential communities.&lt;ref name=felidae1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.felidaefund.org/research/bay_puma.html |title=&quot;Bay Area Puma Project&quot; information page, Felidae Conservation Fund, accessed 18 February 2009 |publisher=Felidaefund.org |accessdate=March 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation threats to the species include persecution as a pest animal, [[environmental degradation]] and [[habitat fragmentation]], and depletion of their prey base. [[Wildlife corridor]]s and sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of 2200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (850&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) or more. As few as one to four new animals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, foregrounding the importance of habitat corridors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beier |first=Paul |year=1993 |month=March |title=Determining Minimum Habitat Areas and Habitat Corridors for Cougars |journal=Conservation Biology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–108 |accessdate=May 20, 2007|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010094.x |jstor=2386646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2011, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] declared the [[Eastern Cougar]] (''Puma concolor couguar'') officially extinct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/northeast/ECougar/newsreleasefinal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships with humans==
===In mythology===
[[Image:MochePuma.jpg|thumb|[[Moche]] puma, [[Larco Museum]] collection]]
The grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The Inca city of [[Cusco]] is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave its name to both Inca regions and people. The [[Moche]] people represented the puma often in their ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The sky and thunder god of the Inca, [[Viracocha]], has been associated with the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kulmar |last=Tarmo |url=http://folklore.ee/folklore/vol12/inca.htm |coauthors=Kait Realo (translator) |title=On the role of Creation and Origin Myths in the Development of Inca State and Religion |accessdate=May 22, 2007 |work=Electronic Journal of Folklore|publisher=Estonian Folklore Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the [[Hocąk language]] (&quot;Ho-Chunk&quot; or &quot;Winnebago&quot;) of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.Cougars.html '' Cougars,''] The Encyclopedia of Hočąk (Winnebago) Mythology. Retrieved: 2009/12/08.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cheyenne]], amongst others. To the [[Apache]] and [[Walapai]] of [[Arizona]], the wail of the Cougar was a harbinger of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/publications/living/cougar.pdf |title=Living with Wildlife: Cougars |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Wildlife Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Livestock predation===
During the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of a total of 13.4&amp;nbsp;million cattle &amp; calves in Texas), 253 Mohair goats, 302 Mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of a total of 2.0&amp;nbsp;million sheep &amp; lambs in Texas) and 562 lambs (0.04% of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million lambs in Texas) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASS-cattle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/Catt//1990s/1990/Catt-07-27-1990.pdf | title = Cattle report 1990 publisher = National Agricultural Statistics Service accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASS-sheep-goats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/SheeGoat//1990s/1990/SheeGoat-02-02-1990.pdf | title = Sheep and Goats report 1990| publisher=National Agricultural Statistics Service |accessdate =September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed 9 calves, 1 horse, 4 colts, 5 goats, 318 sheep and 400 lambs. In both cases, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of [[surplus killing]] have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livestock&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aws.vcn.com/mountain_lion_fact_sheet.html | title = Mountain Lion Fact Sheet | publisher=Abundant Wildlife Society of North America | accessdate =July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cougar's killing bite is typically applied to the back of the neck or head, differing greatly from the throat bite used by coyotes and indiscriminate mutilation by feral dogs. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Predation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/ranchref/predator//cougars/t-cougar.htm | title = Cougar Predation – Description | publisher=Procedures for Evaluating Predation on Livestock and Wildlife | accessdate =August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on humans===
{{See also|List of fatal cougar attacks in North America}}
[[Image:MountainLionAttackProtocol.jpg|thumb|right|Mountain Lion warning sign.]]

Due to the [[overpopulation|expanding human population]], cougar [[range (biology)|range]]s increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by [[humans]]. Attacks on humans are rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Med&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKee |first=Denise |year=2003 |title=Cougar Attacks on Humans: A Case Report |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |publisher=Wilderness Medical Society |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-document&amp;issn=1080-6032&amp;volume=014&amp;issue=03&amp;page=0169 |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |pmid=14518628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when the cat [[Habituation|habituates]] to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovBC&quot;/&gt;

Between 1890 and 1990, in North America there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim).&lt;ref name=&quot;Beier&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Beier |url=http://users.frii.com/mytymyk/lions/beier.htm |title=Cougar attacks on humans in United States and Canada |work=Wildlife Society Bulletin |year=1991 |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Northern Arizon University}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/mtn_lion_attacks.shtml |title=Confirmed mountain lion attacks in the United States and Canada 1890 – present |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California has seen a dozen attacks since 1986 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;California&quot;/&gt; Lightly populated [[New Mexico]] reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062308pinosaltoslion.html Search continues for mountain lion that killed Pinos Altos man], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release June 23, 2008; [http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062508pinosaltoslion.html Wounded mountain lion captured, killed near Pinos Altos], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release June 25, 2008]; [http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/070108pinosaltoslion2.html Second mountain lion captured near Pinos Altos], New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, press release July 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person &quot;[[wikt:play dead|plays dead]]&quot;. Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud but calm shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Med&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GovBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |title=Safety Guide to Cougars |work=Environmental Stewardship Division |year=1991 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 |publisher=[[Government of British Columbia]], Ministry of Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the [[vertebrae]] and into the [[spinal cord]]. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Med&quot;/&gt; Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims–and almost all fatalities–were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in [[British Columbia]], particularly on [[Vancouver Island]] where cougar populations are especially dense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beier&quot;/&gt; Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, including: active during daylight hours, unafraid of humans, and stalking humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabino&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pamphlet: &quot;Mountain Lions in Sabino and Madera Canyons and on Mt.
