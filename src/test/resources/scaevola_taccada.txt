'''''Scaevola taccada''''', also known as '''Beach Cabbage''', '''Sea Lettuce''', '''Beach Naupaka''', '''''Naupaka kahakai''''' ([[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]), '''Magoo''' ([[Maldivian language|Divehi]]), '''''Merambong''''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) and '''''Ngahu''''' ([[Tongan language|Tongan]]) is a [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Goodeniaceae]] found in coastal locations in the [[tropical]] areas of the [[Indo-Pacific]]. It is a common beach shrub throughout the [[Arabian Sea]], the tropical [[Indian Ocean]] and the tropical [[Pacific|Islands]] of the Pacific.

== Description ==

It is a large bush reaching up to about 4&nbsp;m in height typical of [[littoral zone]]s where it grows very close to the sea exposed to the [[salt spray]], usually on sandy or pebbly soils.<ref>[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/analysis_of_post_tsunami_initiatives_sri_lanka.pdf An Assessment of Post Tsunami Restoration and Conservation Initiatives in Coastal Stretch of Matara - IUCN-Sri Lanka Country Office]</ref>
Leaves are slightly [[succulent]], about 20 cm long, closely alternate and crowded at the stem tips. They are [[glabrous]] with a fleshy-looking [[yellowish green]] color. The fruits and flowers are white. ''Scaevola taccada'' blooms the whole year round and the flowers have a [[Hand fan|fan]]-like shape which gives them the name '''Fanflower''' or '''Half flower'''. The fruits float in seawater and are propagated by [[ocean current]]s, this bush being one of the [[pioneer plant]]s in new [[sandbank]]s in tropical areas.<ref name=AustTRFPK6.1>{{AustTRFPK6.1 |url= http://keys.trin.org.au:8080/key-server/data/0e0f0504-0103-430d-8004-060d07080d04/media/Html/taxon/Scaevola_taccada.htm |accessdate=16 Mar 2013 }}</ref>

== Distribution ==

The coastal areas and beaches of - [[Okinawa]], [[Taiwan]], [[Southern China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Northern Australia]], [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[East Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Seychelles]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Chagos islands]], [[Comoros]],  [[RÃ©union]].

== Habitat ==
[[File:Seychelles_017.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Habitat of scaevola taccada on a beach in the Seychelles]]
''Scaevola taccada'' typically grows directly on the beaches of tropical coasts with a preference for beach crests on coral sands. It grows within in the salt spray area and it is amongst the first pioneer plant colonisers on tropical [[Atoll]]s and sandbanks. Besides seeds, it is easy propagated from cuttings.

It prefers well drained sandy soils and it is a very salt tolerant scrub. ''Scaevola taccada'' is sometimes found growing in loose plant communities with [[coconut palm]]s, [[Heliotropium foertherianum|soldierbush]], [[Ipomoea pes-caprae|beach morning glory]], [[Guettarda speciosa|beach gardenia]], several [[pandanus]] species, [[Calophyllum inophyllum|beach calophyllum]] followed by [[Thespesia populnea| portia tree]], [[Terminalia catappa|sea almond]], [[Hibiscus tiliaceus|beach hibiscus]], [[Cordia subcordata]] and others. The plant is often featured prominently on [[tropical island]] postcards and wallpapers.

==Use==
In some islands of the Pacific, ''Scaevola taccada'' is used to prevent [[coastal erosion]] as well as for landscaping. It is also planted on the beach crests to protect other cultivated plants from the salt spray. Parts of the plant are also used in [[Polynesia]]n and Asian [[traditional medicine]].<ref>[http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1532&fr=1&sts=&lang=EN GISD - ''Scaevola sericea'' (shrub)]</ref> It has also been proven to be "an excellent remedy as antidiabetic, antipyretic, antiinflamatory, anticoagulant and as skeletal muscle relaxant without any adverse reactions" by the department of pharmacy of Annamalai University, India <ref>[http://news.discovery.com/history/amelia-earhart-castaway-clues-island.html - ''Amelia Earhart May Have Survived Months as Castaway'']</ref>

Historically tn the [[Maldives]] the leaves of this bush were often used as [[famine food]].<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4398927/Eating_on_the_Islands_-_As_times_have_changed_so_has_the_Maldives_unique_cuisine_and_culture Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture]</ref>

==Invasive Species==
In the United States ( Florida, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands) as well as many other [[Caribbean]] nations and the Bahamas, ''Scaevola taccada'' has become an invasive species, pushing away the native Caribbean ''[[Scaevola plumieri]]'' species from its native habitat.<ref>[http://www.breef.org/InvasiveSpecies/tabid/73/Default.aspx Invasive species in The Bahamas an overview]</ref>
