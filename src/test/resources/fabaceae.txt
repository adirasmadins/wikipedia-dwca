The '''Fabaceae''' or '''Leguminosae''', commonly known as the '''legume''', '''pea''', or '''bean family''', is a large and economically important [[family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s. The group is the third largest [[land plant]] family, behind only the [[Orchidaceae]] and [[Asteraceae]], with 730 genera and over 19,400 species.<ref name="Stevens">Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). ''Angiosperm Phylogeny Website'' Version 9, June 2008 [http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/welcome.html Mobot.org]</ref> The largest genera are ''[[Astragalus]]'' (over 2,400 species), ''[[Acacia]]'' (over 950 species), ''[[Indigofera]]'' (around 700 species), ''[[Crotalaria]]'' (around 700 species), and ''[[Mimosa]]'' (around 500 species).

Plants of this family are found throughout the world, growing in many different environments and climates. A number are important agricultural plants, including: ''[[Glycine max]]'' (soybean), ''[[Phaseolus]]'' (beans), ''[[Pisum sativum]]'' (pea), ''[[Cicer arietinum]]'' (chickpeas), ''[[Medicago sativa]]'' (alfalfa), ''[[Arachis hypogaea]]'' (peanut), ''[[carob|Ceratonia siliqua]]'' (carob), and ''[[licorice|Glycyrrhiza glabra]]'' (licorice), which are among the best known members of Fabaceae.

A number of species are also weedy [[Pest (organism)|pests]] in different parts of the world, including: ''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'' (broom), ''[[Ulex europaeus]]'' (gorse), ''[[Pueraria lobata]]'' (kudzu), and a number of ''[[Lupinus]]'' species.

==Etymology==
The name 'Fabaceae' comes from the defunct genus ''Faba'', now included in ''[[Vicia]]''. The term "faba" comes from Latin, and appears to simply mean "bean".<ref>Wiktionary. "Faba". Searched November, 2011. http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faba</ref>  Leguminosae is an older name still considered valid,<ref>[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] Art. 18.5 (Vienna Code)</ref> and refers to the
l [[fruit]] of these plants, which are called [[legume]]s.

==Distribution==
The Fabaceae has an essentially worldwide distribution, being found everywhere except Antarctica and the high arctic.<ref name="Stevens"/>

==Taxonomy==
The Fabaceae are placed in the order [[Fabales]] according to most taxonomic systems, including the [[APG III system]].  The family includes three subfamilies:
* '''[[Mimosoideae]]''': 80 genera and 3,200 species. Mostly tropical and warm temperate Asia and America. ''[[Mimosa]]'', ''[[Acacia]]''.
* '''[[Caesalpinioideae]]''':<ref>NOTE: The subfamilial name '''Papilionoideae''' for Faboideae is approved by the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], as is 'Leguminosae' for the Fabaceae ''sensu lato''.</ref> 170 genera and 2,000 species, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]]. ''[[Caesalpinia]]'', ''[[Senna (genus)|Senna]]'', ''[[Bauhinia]]'', ''[[Amherstia]]''.
* '''[[Faboideae]]''': 470 genera and 14,000 species, cosmopolitan. ''[[Astragalus]]'', ''[[Lupinus]]''.

These three subfamilies have been alternatively treated at the family level, as in the [[Cronquist system|Cronquist]] and [[Dahlgren system|Dahlgren]] systems. However, this choice has not been supported by late 20th and early 21st century evidence, which has shown the Caesalpinioideae to be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] and the Fabaceae ''sensu lato'' to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name="tolweb">{{cite web | url = http://tolweb.org/Fabaceae/21093/2006.06.14 | title = Fabaceae | author = Martin F. Wojciechowski, Johanna Mahn, and Bruce Jones | year = 2006 | work = The Tree of Life Web Project }}</ref> While the Mimosoideae and the Faboideae are largely [[monophyletic]], the Caesalpinioideae appear to be [[paraphyletic]]<ref name="wojciechowski2004"/><ref name="tolweb"/> and the tribe [[Cercideae]] is probably sister to the rest of the family.<ref name="wojciechowski2004"/><ref name="tolweb"/> Moreover, there are a number of genera whose placement into the Caesalpinioideae is not always agreed on (e.g. ''[[Dimorphandra]]'').

==Description==
[[File:Gymnocladus-dioicus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The fruit of ''[[Gymnocladus dioicus]]'']]
Fabaceae range in habit from giant [[tree]]s (like ''[[Koompassia excelsa]]'') to small [[annual plant|annual]] [[Herbaceous plant|herb]]s, with the majority being herbaceous perennials. Plants have indeterminate inflorescences, which are sometimes reduced to a single flower. The flowers have a short [[hypanthium]] and a single [[carpel]] with a short [[gynophore]], and after fertilization produce fruits that are legumes.

===Roots===
{{main|Root nodule}}
Many Fabaceae host [[bacteria]] in their roots within structures called [[root nodule]]s. These bacteria, known as [[rhizobia]], have the ability to take [[nitrogen]] gas (N<sub>2</sub>) out of the air and convert it to a form of nitrogen that is usable to the host plant ( [[Nitrate|NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]] or [[Ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]] ). This process is called [[nitrogen fixation]]. The legume, acting as a host, and [[rhizobia]], acting as a provider of usable nitrate, form a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.

===Leaves===
The leaves are usually [[phyllotaxis|alternate]] and compound. Most often they are even- or odd-[[pinnate]]ly compound (e.g. ''[[Caragana]]'' and ''[[Robinia]]'' respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. ''[[Trifolium]]'', ''[[Medicago]]'') and rarely [[palmate]]ly compound (e.g. ''[[Lupinus]]''), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Mimosa]]''). They always have [[stipule]]s, which can be leaf-like (e.g. ''[[Pisum]]''), thorn-like (e.g. ''[[Robinia]]'') or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf margins are entire or, occasionally, [[Leaf#Terminology|serrate]]. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled [[pulvinus|pulvini]] to permit [[nastic movements]]. In some species, leaflets have evolved into [[tendril]]s (e.g. ''[[Vicia]]'').

Many species have leaves with structures that attract [[ant]]s that protect the plant from herbivore insects (a form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). [[Nectar#Extrafloral nectaries|Extrafloral nectaries]] are common among the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae, and are also found in some Faboideae (e.g. ''[[Vicia sativa]]''). In some ''[[Acacia]]'', the modified hollow stipules are inhabited by ants.

===Flowers===
[[File:Wisteria sinensis nobackground labels.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A flower of ''[[Wisteria sinensis]]'', Faboideae. Two petals have been removed to show stamens and pistil]]
The [[flower]]s always have five generally fused [[sepal]]s and five free [[petal]]s. They are generally [[plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]], and have a short [[hypanthium]], usually cup shaped. There are normally ten [[stamen]]s and one elongated superior [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], with a curved [[style (botany)|style]]. They are usually arranged in [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|indeterminate]] [[inflorescence]]s. Fabaceae are typically [[entomophily|entomophilous]] plants (i.e. they are pollinated by [[insect]]s), and the flowers are usually showy to attract [[pollinator]]s.

In the [[Caesalpinioideae]], the flowers are often [[zygomorphic]], as in ''[[Cercis]]'', or nearly symmetrical with five equal petals in ''[[Bauhinia]]''. The upper petal is the innermost one, unlike in the [[Faboideae]]. Some species, like some in the genus ''[[Senna (genus)|Senna]]'', have asymmetric flowers, with one of the lower petals larger than the opposing one, and the style bent to one side. The calyx, corolla, or stamens can be showy in this group.

In the [[Mimosoideae]], the flowers are [[actinomorphic]] and arranged in globose [[inflorescences]]. The petals are small and the stamens, which can be more than just ten, have long coloured filaments, which are the most showy part of the flower. All of the flowers in an inflorescence open at once.

In the [[Faboideae]], the flowers are [[zygomorphic]], and have a specialized structure. The upper petal, called the banner, is large and envelops the rest of the petals in bud, often reflexing when the flower blooms. The two adjacent petals, the wings, surround the two bottom petals. The two bottom petals are fused together at the apex (remaining free at the base), forming a boat-like structure called the keel. The stamens are always ten in number, and their filaments can be fused in various configurations, often in a group of nine stamens plus one separate stamen. Various genes in the ''CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/DICHOTOMA (DICH)'' family are expressed in the upper (also called dorsal or adaxial) petal; in some species, such as ''[[Cadia (plant)|Cadia]]'' these genes are expressed throughout the flower, producing a radially symmetrical flower.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/32/12017.full | title = An apparent reversal in floral symmetry in the legume Cadia is a homeotic transformation | author = Hélène L.

===Fruit===
{{main|Legume}}
[[File:Vicia angustifolia4.jpg|thumb|right|Legume of ''[[Vicia angustifolia]]'']]
The ovary most typically develops into a [[legume]]. A legume is a [[Fruit#Simple fruit|simple dry fruit]] that usually [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehisces]] (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name for this type of fruit is a "pod", although that can also be applied to a few other fruit types. A few species have evolved [[Samara (fruit)|samarae]], [[loment]]s, [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]], indehiscent legumes, [[achene]]s, [[drupe]]s, and [[berries]] from the basic legume fruit.

==Evolution==
It has been suggested, based on fossil and phylogenetic evidence, that legumes originally evolved in arid and/or semi-arid regions along the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys seaway]] during the [[Paleogene]] Period.<ref name="Schrire2">{{cite book | last1 = Schrire | first1 = B.

One of the key features of Fabaceae is that some members are able to nodulate. The current hypothesis about the evolution of the genes needed for nodulation is that they were recruited from other pathways after a polyploidy event.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00018-011-0651-4 |title=Function and evolution of nodulation genes in legumes |year=2011 |last1=Yokota |first1=Keisuke |last2=Hayashi |first2=Makoto |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=68 |issue=8 |pages=1341–51 |pmid=21380559}}</ref> Several different pathways have been implicated as donating duplicated genes to the pathways need for nodulation. The main donors to the pathway were the genes associated with the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis genes, the pollen tube formation genes and the haemoglobin genes. One of the main genes shown to be shared between the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway and the nodulation pathway is SYMRK and it is involved in the plant-bacterial recognition.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060068 |title=Functional Adaptation of a Plant Receptor- Kinase Paved the Way for the Evolution of Intracellular Root Symbioses with Bacteria |year=2008 |last1=Markmann |first1=Katharina |last2=Giczey |first2=Gábor |last3=Parniske |first3=Martin |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=e68 |pmid=18318603 |pmc=2270324}}</ref>  The pollen tube growth is similar to the infection thread development in that infection threads grow in a polar manner that is similar to a pollen tubes polar growth towards the ovules.

The family has also evolved a unique chemistry. [[Pterocarpan]]s are a class of molecules (derivatives of [[isoflavonoid]]s) found only in the Fabaceae.

==Uses==
The [[bean#History|history of legumes]] is tied in closely with that of human civilization, appearing early in [[Asia]], the [[Americas]] (the [[common bean]], several varieties) and [[Europe]] (broad beans) by 6,000 [[Anno Domini|BCE]], where they became a staple, essential for supplementing protein where there was not enough meat.

Their ability to [[nitrogen fixation|fix atmospheric nitrogen]] reduces [[fertilizer]] costs for farmers and gardeners who grow legumes, and means that legumes can be used in a [[crop rotation]] to replenish soil that has been depleted of [[nitrogen]]. Legume seeds and foliage have a comparatively higher [[protein]] content than non-legume materials, due to the additional nitrogen that legumes receive through the process. Some legume species perform [[hydraulic redistribution|hydraulic lift]], which makes them ideal for [[intercropping]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Sprent | first = Janet I. | url = http://www.sprentland.com/index.php?pr=Janet | title = Legume Nodulation: A Global Perspective | year = 2009 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Ames, Iowa | isbn = 1-4051-8175-3 | page = 12 }} Preview available at [http://books.google.com/books?id=c-DeQ_wQr3MC&lpg=PA12&ots=nXNlxj2YhQ&dq=legume%20hydraulic%20lift&pg=PR4#v=onepage&q=legume%20hydraulic%20lift&f=false Google Books].</ref>

Farmed legumes can belong to numerous classes, including [[Fodder|forage]], [[cereal|grain]], blooms, pharmaceutical/industrial, fallow/green manure and timber species, with most commercially farmed species filling two or more roles simultaneously.

There are of two broad types of '''forage legumes'''. Some, like [[alfalfa]], [[clover]], [[vetch]], and ''[[Arachis]]'', are sown in [[pasture]] and grazed by livestock. Other forage legumes such as ''[[Leucaena]]'' or ''[[Albizia]]'' are woody shrub or tree species that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide stock feed.

'''Grain legumes''' are cultivated for their [[seed]]s, and are also called [[pulse (legume)|pulse]]s. The seeds are used for human and animal consumption or for the production of [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]]s for industrial uses. Grain legumes include both herbaceous plants like [[bean]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[lupin]]s, [[pea]]s and [[peanut]]s.<ref>The gene bank and breeding of grain legumes (lupine, vetch, soya and beah) / B.S. Kurlovich and S.I. Repyev (Eds.), - St. Petersburg, The N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, 1995, 438p. - (Theoretical basis of plant breeding. V.111)</ref> and trees such as [[carob]], [[mesquite]] and [[tamarind]].

'''Bloom legume''' species include species such as [[lupin]], which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide. ''[[Laburnum]]'', ''[[Robinia]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Mimosa]]'', and ''[[Delonix]]'' are [[Ornamental plant|ornamental]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s.

'''Industrial farmed legumes''' include ''[[Indigofera]]'', cultivated for the production of [[indigo]], ''[[Acacia]]'', for [[gum arabic]], and ''[[Derris]]'', for the insecticide action of [[rotenone]], a compound it produces.

'''Fallow''' or '''[[green manure]]''' legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil to exploit the high nitrogen levels found in most legumes. Numerous legumes are farmed for this purpose, including ''[[Leucaena]]'', ''[[Cyamopsis]]'' and ''[[Sesbania]]''.

Various legume species are farmed for '''timber production''' worldwide, including numerous ''[[Acacia]]'' species, ''[[Dalbergia]]'' species, and ''[[Castanospermum australe]]''.<!-- Previously Erythroxylum was listed, but I replaced it with Dalbergia.  Erythroxylum is not in this family, and I'm not sure if it is even grown for timber.-->
